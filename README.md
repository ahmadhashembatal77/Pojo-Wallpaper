#### üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture
PojoWallpaper follows the Clean Architecture structure and MVVM. <br> 
- The domain layer contains UseCases that encapsulate a single, specific task that is part of the application's business logic. <br>
- The data layer implements the repository interface defined in the domain layer, providing a single source of truth for data. <br>
- The UI layer and ViewModel layers, use all the components and classes related to the Android framework to get the data from the ViewModel layer and display it on the device.
